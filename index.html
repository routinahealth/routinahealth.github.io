          have you or a loved one been diagnosed with depression? maybe anxiety? a sprinkle of ADHD?
          worry not! routina is a mental health application made for <i>you.</i>

        we at routina labs incorporated (not actually incorporated) understand that sometimes it's hard
        to keep a routine, to keep a schedule, to not procrastinate. this project itself is a product of procrastination!
        </br>
        <p class="color">
          well, what is it exactly?
        </p>
        let's cut to the chase. routina is an application made for those who struggle with schedules, by those who struggle with schedules. 
</br></br>we have high hopes for routina; we want to make an application that everyone will be happy to use (no matter how old or young!)

<p class="color">
  hopes
</p>
we believe that making a schedule into something a bit more fun (like the bonus shop) will make people at least a <i>little</i> more excited to use their schedule.
</br></br> we're as <div class="woah inline">thrilled</div> for the future as you are.
