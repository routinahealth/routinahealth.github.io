        routina is a mental health application focused on personalization.
      </p>
      <div class="small-content">
        have you or a loved one been diagnosed with depression? maybe anxiety? a sprinkle of ADHD?
        worry not! routina is a mental health application made for <i>you.</i>
        </br>
        </br>
        we at routina labs incorporated (not actually incorporated) understand that sometimes it's hard
        to keep a routine, to keep a schedule, to not procrastinate. this project itself is a product of procrastination!
        </br>
        </br>
        let's cut to the chase. routina is an application made for those who struggle with schedules, by those who struggle with schedules. 
        </br>
        <p class="color">it features:</p>
      </br>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              a simple, readable schedule
            </br></br>
              <img src="schedule.png" />
            </th>
            <th>
              customization
            </br></br>
              <img src="builder.png" />
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr><th></br></th></tr>
          <tr>
            <th>
              bonuses!
            </br></br>
              <img src="bonus.png" />
            </th>
            <th>
              professional help
            </br></br>
              <img src="help.png" />
            </th>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </br>
        it looks simple, and that's because it is! routina is built for simplicity, so you don't have to put as many brain units into your new schedule!
    </br></br>
        we know you're asking: <div class="color inline">where can i download this?</div> well, it's not available for download yet.
  </br></br>
        we know, it's sad. in the future, though, routina will be released as a mobile app, and will later be released as a desktop app across all operating systems! 
</br></br>we have high hopes for routina; we want to make an application that everyone will be happy to use (no matter how old or young!)
</br></br>we believe that making a schedule into something a bit more fun (like the bonus shop) will make people at least a <i>little</i> more excited to use their schedule.
</br></br> we're as <div class="woah inline">thrilled</div> for the future as you are.
