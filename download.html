            we know, it's sad. in the future, though, routina will be released as a mobile app, and will later be released as a desktop app across all operating systems! 
          </br></br>
          routina will be released sometime in 2022, assuming no major delays. of course, we aren't psychics, but it's a reasonable estimate. 
        </br>
        <p class="color">priorities</p>
        our priorities are currently to get the application running on windows systems first, as it is the easiest to deploy initially. afterwards, we will focus on mobile development and finally focus on linux, mac, etc.
