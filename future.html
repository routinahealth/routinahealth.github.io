            routina is starting from the ground up.
          </p>
          <div class="small-content appear">
              an application built off the hopes and dreams of a couple students, routina's plans are <b>big.</b>
          </br></br>
          things won't be perfect from the start: there will likely be developmental delays (especially with the pandemic), there will be bugs to squash, but in the end there will be a product.
          <p class="color">
            when will routina be released?
          </p>
          more info can be found on our <a href="download.html">download page</a>, but as of January 2022, the release goal is for the end of the year.
          <p class="color">
            will routina continue to be free?
          </p>
          our intentions are to keep routina free to use for the entirety of its lifespan. whether we have to resort to in-app ads or donations, we want to make the app as accessible to the public as possible. we want to <i>help</i>, not hinder.
