                    create a (mostly) bug-free application that is easy to use and unintimidating.

                    build a development team with similar goals: helping people.

                but we assure you, we will do everything in our power in order to make sure that this product succeeds. at the least, a working, mostly feature-rich application will be available by the end of 2022.
